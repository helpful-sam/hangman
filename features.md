IMPLEMENTED
  1. graphics (title and hangman ASCII)
  2. random word selection from Oxford 3000 & 5000
  3. difficulty selection
  4. game over when lives run out
  5. input logic (guessing and appropriate hangman drawing updates)
  6. change difficulty after death
  7. option to continue playing after death

IN DEVELOPEMENT
  1. bug where first guess of 'e' is invalid ONLY IN NORMAL DIFFICULTY

PLANNED
  1. 2 player mode (user inputs secret word)
  2. make difficulty more meaningful -- have shorter words be "easier"?
  3. show the alphabet and cross off ones already guessed
